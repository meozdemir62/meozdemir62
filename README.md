- 🧬 My work focuses on pediatric T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), multiple myeloma and (more recently) pediatric low-grade glioma.
- 👀 I’m interested in using single cell sequencing approaches to characterize the immune microenvironment in different cancers.
- 🌱 I’m a self-taught coder/computational biologist, most comfortable with the languages R and Python. 
- 💞️ I’m hoping to continue my studies in graduate school, focusing on bioinformatics/biostatistics.
